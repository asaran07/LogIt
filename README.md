# LogIt

### The Origin
The idea for this project came from an assignment in one of my classes where at the end of each week, we had to turn in a reflection detailing what we worked on, the time spent, and engagement levels for those activities.

### The Problem
I was too lazy to write down or keep track of all the activities I did, much less keep track of the details regarding them. With a hectic schedule, using another app to track my work felt burdensome, and I didn't want to write anything down manually either. This left me scrambling at the end of the week, trying to remember what I did and for how long and when.

### The Dream
My dream was to create an application that would let me log everything quickly and efficiently. No extra menus, no dragging the mouse around to find options or settings, and no learning curve. I wanted a way to log and track my activities within seconds, using just a few keystrokes.

### The Future
My goal is to make this dream a reality, and even better. Upon launching the application, I want to be greated with minimal but expressive graphs/visuals, all the necessary options, and an intuitive UI. I created LogIt to help not only myself but also anyone else with a similar dream.

### Main Features
- Log time spent on various activities, quickly.
- Create and manage activities, fast.
- View logs and visual graphs of past activities, instantly.

## Development Plan
#### Improved Data Management:
- Store activities and logs in a structured format, using JSON or a database like SQLite for persistent storage, allowing syncing of activities and logs across sessions.
#### Enhanced User Interface:
- Add more feedback messages to guide the user through the menus and actions.
- Use additional colors or text attributes to make the interface more visually appealing.
#### Detailed Logs Menu:
- Expand the Logs Menu to display detailed logs for each activity.
- Allow filtering and sorting of logs by date, duration, or engagement level.
#### Error Handling:
- Implement error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-numeric duration or engagement values.
#### User Configuration:
- Allow users to configure and customize the activity types and other settings.
#### Advanced Features:
- Allow users to export logs to a file (CSV or JSON).
- Implement more detailed logging options, such as start/end times and comments.
