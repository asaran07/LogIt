# LogIt

### The Origin
The idea for this project came from a reflection assignment in one of my classes. At the end of each week, we had to turn in a reflection detailing what we worked on, the time spent, and engagement levels for those activities.

### The Problem
I was too lazy to write down or keep track of all the activities I did. With a hectic schedule, using another app to track my work felt cumbersome, and I didn't want to write anything down manually. This left me scrambling at the end of the week, trying to remember what I did and for how long.

### The Dream
My dream was to create an application that would let me log everything quickly and efficiently. No extra menus, no dragging the mouse around to find options or settings, and no learning curve. I wanted a way to log and track my activities within seconds, using just a few keystrokes.

### The Future
My goal is to make this dream a reality, and even better. Upon launching the application, I wanted to be greated with, minimal but expressive graphs/visuals, all the necessary options, and an intuitive UI. I created LogIt to help not only myself but also anyone else with a similar dream.
